To visualize California house prices using latitude and longitude on a map, we can utilize the Python library Folium. Folium is ideal for creating interactive maps that plot data points, such as house locations, based on their geographic coordinates.

By using latitude and longitude data for each house, markers can be placed on the map at their respective locations. Additionally, custom features like pop-ups or color-coding can be added to the markers to indicate different price ranges, helping to easily visualize and compare house prices across California.
